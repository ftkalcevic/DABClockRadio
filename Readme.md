Inspired by a project on Hackday (<a href="http://hackaday.com/2014/09/18/sprite_tm-puts-linux-in-a-clock-radio/">Hackaday Link</a> and <a href="http://spritesmods.com/?art=clockradio&page=1">Original Source Link</a>) I replaced the internals
of my clock radio.

There were 2 problems with my aging clock radio - 1 no battery back-up after a power loss, and 2 poor radio tuning through the analog tuner.
